The block displays all existing groups and groupings as well as all enrolled groups on request.
The number inside the brackets displays the number of members in a group or grouping.
Additionally groups can be hidden, illustrated by an eye icon and a change in opacity.
When the icon is clicked the visibility of groups changes. Javascript files exist to update the block.
When the block is installed for the first time all groups are hidden</br>
